# GitHub Repository Management Agent

This GitHub Repository Management Agent enables users to interact with GitHub repositories, offering features such as retrieving repository details, creating issues, comparing repositories, listing issues, and fetching the README content. It uses the Fetch.ai uAgents framework to manage these interactions asynchronously.

## üìå Features

- **Get Repository Details**: Retrieve essential information such as name, description, stars, forks, and open issues for any GitHub repository.
- **Create Issues**: Quickly create new issues in a specified repository, providing both a title and body for the issue.
- **Compare Repositories**: Compare two repositories by analyzing their descriptions, stars, forks, and open issues.
- **List Issues**: View all open issues in a repository, with titles and issue numbers.
- **Fetch README Content**: Retrieve and display the content of a repository's README file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/github-agent
   cd github-agent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages.

   ```bash
   pip install requests uagents
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub API Tokens**:
   Replace the placeholders in the code (`GITHUB_TOKEN_DETAILS` and `GITHUB_TOKEN_ISSUE`) with your actual GitHub API tokens for authenticating requests.

4. **Run the Agent**:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

5. **Agent Protocols**:
   The agent uses a protocol to handle different types of requests (e.g., retrieving repository details, creating issues). Each request follows the `GitHubRepoRequest` model and sends a response using `UAgentResponse`.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Business Model

This agent could be monetized as an API service to help developers or teams manage GitHub repositories more efficiently. Potential clients include:

- **Development Teams**: Automate repository management tasks such as issue tracking and documentation updates.
- **Project Managers**: Use the agent to compare project metrics, like stars and forks, when evaluating open-source projects.
- **Education & Training**: Teaching GitHub workflows to new developers with automated assistance.
